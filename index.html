            I was born in Denver Colorado, but
            raised in Southern California. I have one
            brother, and one sister and they are
            approximately 15 years younger than
            myself. After living in California for many
            years, I now reside in the Pacific North
            West and love it.

        <div class="div-2">
            My am passionate about a few things and
            they vary from my four kids, to playing
            the bass guitar. I am most passionate
            about my faith as a non-donominatioanl
            christian, which is not so popular these
            days. I also love to code and play chess,
            and listen to good music.

            I will mention a couple of fun facts about
            myself here. One, is both my brother and
            sister were adobted at birth when I was about
            15 years old. I was present at both of their
            births. Another interesting but painful fact,
            is when I was a Geotechnical Engeineering Inspector
            my right foot was crushed by an excavator. Thank-
            fully I did not lose my foot.
